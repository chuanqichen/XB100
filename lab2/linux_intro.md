# Getting Started with Linux

Most robotics programming is done using the Linux operating system. This is mainly due to the large amount of open-source robotics software that has been developed on it. Linux itself is **open-source**. Open-source software is software that is free to use, distribute to others, and modify. You will use **Ubuntu 18.04,** which is a Linux distribution (packaging of the OS and other software). Ubuntu is one of the most popular Linux distros, and is the main operating system used here in UTCS.

## Getting to a Web Browser

A grid of nine dots will be displayed on the launcher to the left of the monitor in the bottom left-hand corner.

1. Click on the grid icon. This will open the "lens."
2. Type in "google-chrome."
3. Go to https://texas-robotics-academy.com/ to get to this site.


## Getting to a Terminal

1. Click on the applications overview button
2. Type in "terminator."
3. A terminal window will open.

{{site.data.alerts.note}}
The easiest way to access Terminator is to hit Ctrl-Alt-T
{{site.data.alerts.end}}


## Terminator

There are many terminals available for Linux. We will be using Terminator because it has a feature allowing you to multiple panes open at once in the same window. This makes it easy to keep track when you need multiple terminal windows (which we often do).

- `ctrl` + `shift` + `o`: Split the current window horizontally
- `ctrl` + `shift` + `e`: Split the current pane vertically
- `ctrl` + `shift` + `w`: Close the current window

## The Super Key
Under Linux, the Windows *Start key* or MacOS *Command Key* is called the `super` key.
- Pressing `super` by itself will open lens.

## Changing Windows

Hit `alt`+`tab` or `super`+`tab` to cycle windows, or click on the icons on the launcher.

## Snapping Windows
Try these options to see how "window snapping" works.

- `Super`+`Up`: make the window fill the screen 
- `Super`+`Left`: Snap the window to the left half of the screen
- `Super`+`Right`: Snap the window to the right half of the screen
- `Super`+`Down`: Unsnap the window, returning it to its normal size

## Locking Frequently-Used Programs to the Launcher

1. Right-click on the application icon that you would like to lock to the launcher.
2. Click "Add to Favorites."

## Basic Linux Commands

Here a few commands you will need during the course of this camp. Try them out.

Command | Example | What it does
------- | ------- | ------------
ls | ls . | Lists the contents of the current directory.
mkdir | mkdir new | Makes a directory.
cd | cd new | Enters a different directory.
pwd | pwd | Tells you what directory you are in. "Present Working Directory"

When you first open the terminal you will see a command prompt. You will be in your home directory. If you type `pwd`, you will see the "path" to your home directory.

The path given to you by `pwd` is called an "absolute path." If you type an absolute path anywhere in the system, it will always refer to the same place. Absolute paths begin with "/".

A relative path is any path that does not begin with "/". Relative paths are stated relative to your present working directory. If you type "cd Downloads" from your home directory, it will go to the Downloads directory inside your home directory.

Here are a few shortcuts that you can use when forming paths.

 Shortcut | Meaning | Detail 
 ------- | ------- | ------
 ~     | Home directory.            | A space set aside for each user to store their files. 
 .     | The current directory.     | Where you are now, in the filesystem.                                                      
 ..    | The parent directory.      | The directory in which the current directory is stored.                                                      
 /     | The root directory.        | The very top of the computer's filesystem.            

Here's a quick exercise to try this all out.


{{ site.data.alerts.terminal_commands }}
mkdir linux_exercise
ls
cd linux_exercise
ls ..
cd ..
ls
mkdir linux_exercise/subdirectory
cd ~/linux_exercise/subdirectory
pwd
cd ~
{{ site.data.alerts.terminal_commands_end }}

This is basically a text-based version of double clicking on folders, but the command line is a powerful tool which you will use all week.

## Tab Completion

The command line has tab-completion. If you start typing the name of a file, directory, or command and hit tab, it will finish the name for you. If there is more than one match, all possible options are displayed.

{{site.data.alerts.tip}}
Don't forget about tab completion! It's a HUGE timesaver, especially when you have to type long commands.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

As an example, make sure you are in your home directory:

{{ site.data.alerts.terminal_commands }}
cd ~
{{ site.data.alerts.terminal_commands_end }}

There should be a Documents directory inside your home directory. You can check this by typing:

{{ site.data.alerts.terminal_commands }}
ls
{{ site.data.alerts.terminal_commands_end }}

Now in your terminal, type "cd Doc" and hit tab. The terminal should have auto-filled the line with "Documents/". When you click enter, you will be led into the "Documents" directory.

## Bash History
All of your commands are stored in the order you typed them in ~/.bash_history. This lets you easily run previous commands without having to type them again by hitting the `up-arrow` on your keyboard while you're in the terminal. Try it right now. You should see the last command you typed in the terminal.

## VSCode 

We will use an IDE called Visual Studio Code (VSCode). An **IDE** is an Integrated Development Environment, and provides features like syntax highlighting, code completion, debugging tools, etc.

To open VSCode you can do one of two things:

* Open a terminal, type `code` and hit Enter.
* Open the lens and type `vscode` and select the icon for VSCode.


## Shutting Down

Before you finish for the day, make sure you save all your work and turn off the computer. Open the account menu in the top right-hand corner of your screen, click the shut down icon, and select shut down from the power options.

{{site.data.alerts.note}}
If you are running Ubuntu from a USB, please do not unplug the USB before your computer has fully shut down, as this may corrupt files on the USB.
